;;; Commentary:

;; Here are the definitions of most of the general-purpose functions and
;; commands added by Prelude.  Some modules define additional module-specific
;; functions and commands.
;;
;; Note that many of the original core Prelude commands were extracted to the
;; crux package (Prelude installs it automatically).  Prelude's auto-save
;; functionality was extracted to the super-save package.
