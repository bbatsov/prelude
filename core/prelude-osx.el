;;; Code:

;; On OS X Emacs doesn't use the shell PATH if it's not started from
;; the shell. Let's fix that:
(prelude-ensure-module-deps '(exec-path-from-shell))
(require 'exec-path-from-shell)
(exec-path-from-shell-initialize)

;; It's all in the Meta
(setq ns-function-modifier 'hyper)

(defun prelude-swap-meta-and-super ()
  "Swap the mapping of Meta and Super.
Very useful for people using their Mac with a
Windows external keyboard from time to time."
  (interactive)
  (if (eq mac-command-modifier 'super)
      (progn
        (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
        (setq mac-option-modifier 'super)
        (message "Command is now bound to META and Option is bound to SUPER."))
    (progn
