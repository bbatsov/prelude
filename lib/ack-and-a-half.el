;;
;; ack-and-a-half.el provides a simple compilation mode for the perl
;; grep-a-like ack (http://petdance.com/ack/).
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ack-and-a-half")
;; (autoload 'ack-and-a-half-same "ack-and-a-half" nil t)
;; (autoload 'ack-and-a-half "ack-and-a-half" nil t)
;; (autoload 'ack-and-a-half-find-file-samee "ack-and-a-half" nil t)
;; (autoload 'ack-and-a-half-find-file "ack-and-a-half" nil t)
;; (defalias 'ack 'ack-and-a-half)
;; (defalias 'ack-same 'ack-and-a-half-same)
;; (defalias 'ack-find-file 'ack-and-a-half-find-file)
;; (defalias 'ack-find-file-same 'ack-and-a-half-find-file-same)
;;
;; Run `ack' to search for all files and `ack-same' to search for
;; files of the same type as the current buffer.
;;
;; `next-error' and `previous-error' can be used to jump to the
;; matches.
;;
;; `ack-find-file' and `ack-find-same-file' use ack to list the files
;; in the current project.  It's a convenient, though slow, way of
;; finding files.
