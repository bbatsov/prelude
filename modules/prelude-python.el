(require 'python)

(defun prelude-python-mode-defaults ()
  (run-hooks 'prelude-prog-mode-hook) ;; run manually; not derived from prog-mode
  (electric-indent-mode -1))

(setq prelude-python-mode-hook 'prelude-python-mode-defaults)

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda () (run-hooks 'prelude-python-mode-hook)))

(provide 'prelude-python)
