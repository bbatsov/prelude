;;; Commentary:

;; tuareg is the preferred ocaml mode for Emacs

;; These setups for ocaml assume that you are using the OPAM package
;; manager (http://opam.ocaml.org/).

;; Because of the apparent complexity of getting emacs environment
;; variables setup to use opam correctly, it is instead easier to use
;; opam itself to execute any necessary commands.

;; Also, the standard OCaml toplevel usage has been replaced in favor
;; of UTOP, the universal toplevel, and we assume that you are using
;; the Jane Street Core libraries rather than the regular OCaml
;; standard libraries

;; The minimum required setup for using Prelude's OCaml setup would be
;; to install OPAM, and then, minimally `opam install core utop'.  A
;; good getting started guide is available at
;; https://github.com/realworldocaml/book/wiki/Installation-Instructions
