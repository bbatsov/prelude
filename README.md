## Prelude

Emacs is probably the best text editor in the world. However, the
process of coming up with a useful Emacs configuration is long and
difficult. It's this process that separates you from truly taking
advantage of Emacs's power. I like to refer to this process as the
**Prelude**. The **Emacs Prelude** has the goal to ease the initial
Emacs setup process and to provide you with a much more powerful and
productive experience than that you get out of the box. By using **Emacs
Prelude** you're basically getting a "Get me out of the Prelude, I
just want to use Emacs" card.

Emacs Prelude is compatible **ONLY with GNU Emacs 24**. While Emacs 24
is not yet officially released it's a rock solid piece of software
more than suitable for everyday work. There is no good excuse not to
use Emacs 24!

## Fast Forward

Assuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,
etc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as `git` & `curl` you
can skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the
following command:

`curl -L
https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh
| sh`

You can now power up your Emacs, sit back and enjoy Prelude.

I'd like to include a nice variety of Emacs 24 themes into Prelude -
so if you've developed (or simply found) one - give me a shout and
I'll take a look at it.
