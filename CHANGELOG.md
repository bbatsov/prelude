# Change log

## master (unreleased)

### New features

* Enable `nlinum-mode` by default. Can be disabled by setting `prelude-minimalistic-ui` to `nil`.
* Enable Site installation for prelude

### Changes

* [#1278](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/issues/1278): Don't disable `menu-bar-mode` unless `prelude-minimalistic-ui` is enabled.
* [#1277](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/issues/1277): Make it possible to disable the creation of `Super`-based keybindings via `prelude-super-keybindings`.
* Removed deprecated alias `prelude-ensure-module-deps`.
* Remove `prelude-fullscreen`, as these days people can use `toggle-frame-fullscreen` instead. (it was introduced in Emacs 24.4)
* Removed `beacon-mode`.
* Add the `ag` package. It provides a nice alternative to `grep` and has nice Projectile integration.
* Auto-install `adoc-mode` for AsciiDoc files.
