;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This file is just a list of Prelude modules to load on startup.
;; For convenience the modules are grouped in several categories.
;; The prelude-modules.el in the samples folder should be copied
;; to your personal folder and edited there.

;; Note that some modules can't be used together - e.g. you shouldn't
;; enable both prelude-ido and prelude-ivy, as they serve the same
;; purpose.
