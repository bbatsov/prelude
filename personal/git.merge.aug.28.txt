I am now in hostname eribertto-nuc7i5bnh
my emacs.d branch name is aug25, the other is master
git branch remote is origin	https://github.com/eribertto/emacs.prelude.git (fetch/push)
in main GH repo there are 3 branches: master(fork), develop (purcemac/rhinolinux box) and aug25 (this box)
in GH i want to merge commits of develop to master then in local machine to switch to master to pull the merge then create another branch
after merge in GH the develop branch will be deleted since it will return again on the next push from the Thinkpad box
Damn i made a mistake making PR to the original repo https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude
So i closed the PR and deleted the develop branch
Back to my repo the devel branch is gone, damn
